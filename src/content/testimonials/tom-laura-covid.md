Arron arrived on time and was polite and very positive about the project from day one. Works began in February 2020 with the stripping out of the property after Arron had arranged all the necessary trades and the all important paperwork! Arron managed to keep the project ticking along smoothly throughout the COVID-19 lockdown and completed the project at the end of September 2020. As remote clients it was very important for us to have a trusted and open working relationship which Arron provided throughout. Regular updates and photos of progress via whatapp and email made the project easier to manage and worked perfectly for us.
