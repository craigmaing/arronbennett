Arron and his team carried out all of the external building work to landscape our garden. This included working with slate stone to build terraced traditional hedges, laying reclaimed granite cobbles to create pathways and working with reclaimed and new granite, lime mortar and slate flagstones. The work they carried out was completed to an exceptional standard, it is very rare to find a team that has the traditional skills required to build something that looks as though it was always there and blends in seamlessly with buildings from a bygone age. They always work with a smile and genuine enthusiasm and we genuinely enjoyed having them here immensely. I am absolutely sure it won't be long until they are back again.
