# Agent Task: We Can Help You Section Improvement

## Agent Role
**UX/UI Design Specialist Agent** - Expert in modern web design patterns, conversion optimization, and visual hierarchy for professional services websites.

## Mission
Analyze and completely redesign the "We Can Help You" section on the Lighthouse Mentoring homepage to make it visually compelling, clearly communicate value, and drive conversions.

## Current Context
- **Project**: Lighthouse Mentoring Website (Executive Coaching/Wellbeing Advisory)
- **Target Audience**: C-suite executives, senior leaders, board members
- **Design System**: Navy blue (#1A2D4D), Coral accent (#F27A5E), Crimson Pro serif headlines, Inter sans-serif body
- **File Location**: `C:\Users\Fearn\ab1\arron-bennett-astro\src\pages\index.astro`

## Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Current State Analysis
1. Read and analyze the current "We Can Help You" section in index.astro
2. Take a screenshot or describe current implementation
3. Identify specific issues:
   - Layout problems
   - Visual hierarchy issues
   - Content presentation weaknesses
   - Engagement/conversion barriers
4. Document findings in structured format

### Phase 2: Research & Competitive Analysis
1. Research modern design patterns for service/benefit sections on:
   - Executive coaching websites
   - Professional consulting services
   - B2B service providers
2. Analyze competitor examples from COMPETITOR-ANALYSIS.md
3. Research design trends:
   - Icon-based layouts
   - Card-based designs
   - Feature grids
   - Image-driven sections
   - Interactive elements
4. Document 5-7 inspiring examples with rationale

### Phase 3: Design Options Development
1. Create 2-3 distinct design concepts:
   - **Option A**: [Describe approach, e.g., "Icon-based grid with hover effects"]
   - **Option B**: [Describe approach, e.g., "Card-based layout with imagery"]
   - **Option C**: [Describe approach, e.g., "Split-screen with alternating content"]
2. For each option, document:
   - Visual description
   - Layout structure
   - Content hierarchy
   - Pros/cons
   - Conversion effectiveness
   - Implementation complexity
3. Provide recommendation with clear rationale

### Phase 4: Implementation
1. Choose the strongest design approach
2. Implement the new section:
   - Create/update necessary components
   - Ensure responsive design (mobile-first)
   - Implement accessibility features (ARIA, semantic HTML)
   - Match design system (colors, typography, spacing)
   - Add subtle animations if appropriate
3. Test across viewport sizes
4. Validate HTML and accessibility

## Design Considerations

### Visual Hierarchy
- Clear headline that answers "What problems do you solve?"
- Scannable benefit statements
- Visual elements that support (not distract from) content
- Clear call-to-action

### Conversion Elements
- Problem-solution framing
- Outcome-focused language
- Trust signals (credentials, results)
- Clear next steps

### Technical Requirements
- Responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Performant (no heavy images without optimization)
- Semantic HTML structure

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Visually compelling and professional
- [ ] Clear value proposition
- [ ] Easy to scan and understand
- [ ] Matches design system
- [ ] Responsive across all devices
- [ ] Accessible (screen reader tested)
- [ ] Improves upon current implementation

## Deliverables
1. Analysis document with current state issues
2. Research summary with design pattern examples
3. 2-3 design option proposals with rationale
4. Implemented code in index.astro
5. Before/after comparison
6. Implementation notes and recommendations

## Timeline
- Phase 1: 30 minutes
- Phase 2: 45 minutes
- Phase 3: 30 minutes
- Phase 4: 45 minutes
