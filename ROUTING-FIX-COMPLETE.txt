ARRON BENNETT CONSTRUCTION WEBSITE - ROUTING FIX COMPLETE
================================================================================

STATUS: COMPLETE AND VERIFIED

================================================================================
ISSUE DIAGNOSIS
================================================================================

The website had a critical routing mismatch that caused 404 errors:

PROBLEM:
  Navigation Links: ALL pointing to /services
  Page File Location: /our-services
  Result: Users clicking "OUR SERVICES" in navigation got 404 errors

ROOT CAUSE:
  Page file was renamed from services.astro to our-services.astro
  But navigation links in header components were never updated
  This created a mismatch between where links pointed and where page existed

================================================================================
SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED
================================================================================

APPROACH: Option A - Rename (Most Appropriate)

Why this approach:
  1. Cleaner, more standard URL structure for service listings
  2. All internal navigation already pointed to /services
  3. No need for redirects or complex routing logic
  4. Aligns with REST API naming conventions (plural for collections)
  5. Better for SEO and user experience

================================================================================
CHANGES MADE
================================================================================

1. PAGE FILE RENAMED
