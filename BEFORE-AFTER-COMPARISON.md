# Client Feedback Card - Before/After Visual Comparison

## Image Contrast Fix - Visual Results

---

## BEFORE: cottage-refurbishment-penryn/image951.jpg

**Issue**: Bright exterior cottage photo
- Light-colored cottage walls (white/cream)
- Bright sky and sunny conditions
- Minimal shadows or darker areas
- **Result**: White text completely washed out, unreadable

**Why It Failed**:
- Exterior shots in daylight = maximum brightness
- Light building materials reflect light
- No natural dark areas for text contrast
- Even 85% overlay couldn't darken enough without making image muddy

---

## AFTER: barn-conversion-kitchen-roseland/A-Bennett-122.jpg

**Solution**: Interior kitchen renovation photo
- Natural darker tones (stone wall, dark cabinets)
- Interior lighting creates depth and shadows
- Multiple contrast zones throughout image
- **Result**: White text clearly readable, professional appearance

**Why It Works**:
- Interior spaces naturally darker than exteriors
- Stone wall provides excellent textured background
- Cabinet tones complement overlay without competing
- 85% overlay creates perfect balance of contrast and visibility

## Design Principle Applied

**"Form Follows Function"**

Instead of forcing a bright image to work with excessive darkening:
- Selected image naturally suited to the purpose
- Maintained visual appeal while ensuring readability
- Balanced aesthetics with accessibility
- Result: Professional, functional, beautiful ✓

---

## Key Takeaway

**The right image eliminates the need for heavy manipulation.**

By choosing an interior shot with natural darker tones, we achieved:
✓ Perfect text contrast
✓ Professional appearance
✓ Better context for testimonials
✓ Improved performance (smaller file size)
✓ Enhanced user experience

All without increasing overlay darkness or compromising image visibility.

**Lesson Learned**: When designing for text overlays, prioritize images with natural contrast rather than attempting to force bright images to work through heavy darkening.
